This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

You can use your own algorithm or explore and utilize already existed algorithms with alterations.
